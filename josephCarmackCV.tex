\section*{Statement of Intent}

I desire to work in an intellectually open environment where ideas are
exchanged freely with the intent of developing new technology to broadly impact
society. I value diversity and the refinement that comes from innovating with a
team from varied backgrounds towards a common goal.  Respecting differences and
honesty are qualities I highly value in those I work with and strive to embody
myself. I believe that a unified team, with commitment and constant effort can
achieve amazing results that will bring about a bright future.

\section*{Research Interests}

I would like to assist in efforts to demystify intelligence and how it is
implemented in both biological and machine systems. My research has focused
on understanding existing cognitive architectures and their ability to generalise
to a broad spectrum of problems. I have spent time surveying and implementing
state of the art {\bf deep learning techniques for supervised, unsupervised, and
reinforcement learning} tasks. I am interested in new deep learing algorithms
and training techniques, as well as drawing inspiration from biologicial theories
of intelligence in order to create {\bf next generation machine learning and artificial
intelligence algorithms}.

    {
    \vspace{2pt}
    Average class of 50 undergraduate students, prepared and adapted lecture
    notes, delivered lectures, developed online learning videos to supplement
    lecture material (see my website), taught engineers to program in Matlab
    and implement state of the art numerical methods using hands on homework
    assignments, prepared and administered exams to asses learning and assign
    grades, ran drill sessions and held office hours to mentor individual
    students. Performed all grading of homeworks and exams personally.
